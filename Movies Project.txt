A. Find the number of movies released between 1950 and 1960.

movies_between_1950_to_1960 = FILTER movies by year>1950 and year<1960;
DUMP movies_between_1950_to_1960;

B. Find the number of movies having rating more than 4.

 movies_rating_morethan_four = FILTER movies BY rating>4.0;
 DUMP movies_rating_morethan_four;

C. Find the movies whose rating are between 3 and 4.

movies_rating_3_to_4 = FILTER movies BY rating>3.0 and rating<4.0;
DUMP movies_rating_3_to_4;

D. Find the number of movies with duration more than 2 hours (7200 second).

movies_duration_morethan_2hrs = FILTER movies by duration > 7200;
DUMP movies_duration_morethan_2hrs;

E. Find the list of years and number of movies released each year.

group_by_year = group movies by year;
count_by_year = FOREACH group_by_year GENERATE group, COUNT(movies);
DUMP count_by_year;

F. Find the total number of movies in the dataset.

group_up = GROUP count_by_year ALL;
sum_up = FOREACH group_up GENERATE SUM(count_by_year.$1);
DUMP sum_up;
